# CraftingInterpreters

"CraftingInterpreters" is a highly readable book on programming language implementation and theory available from https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/. The official repo containing the book and the Lox language is at https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters. This repo is merely my work to follow the examples.
